# Timelapse
timelapse is a simple solution to continously store specific URL's in a root/project-path and create timelapse-videos out of them.

An example crontab entry to run this script (with the example.conf-file) regularly follows:
```
*/10 * * * * /path/to/timelapse-clone/timelapse.sh example
```
